Solidity Cookbook - Examples on how to code Solidity for Ethereum.

A smart contract is a self-executing computer protocol created with the popularization of cryptocurrencies and made to facilitate and reinforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, providing reliability in online transactions. Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts. It is used to implement smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably Ethereum. <br>

Ethereum is a decentralized platform capable of executing smart contracts and decentralized applications using blockchain technology: They are applications that work exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, fraud or interference from third parties, because the contract is immutable.
